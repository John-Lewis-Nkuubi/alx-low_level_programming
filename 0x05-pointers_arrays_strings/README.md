#0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and string
##Learning Objectives
*By the end of this project, i was able to explain, without the help of Google the following;*
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

##PROJECTS
0-reset_to_98.c; a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

1-swap.c; a function that swaps the values of two integers.

2-strlen.c; a function that returns the length of a string.

3-puts.c; a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

4-print_rev.c; a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5-rev_string.c; a function that reverses a string.

6-puts2.c;  a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7-puts_half.c; a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
- The function prints the second half of the string
- If the number of characters is odd, the function prints the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

8-print_array.c; a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
- n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
- Numbers areseparated by comma, followed by a space
- The numbers are displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array

9-strcpy.c; a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
- Return value: the pointer to dest

100-atoi.c; a function that convert a string to an integer.
- The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
- all the - and + signs before the number are accounted for
- If there are no numbers in the string, the function returns 0
- long isnt in use
- new variables of “type” array are not declared
- special values are not hard-coded

101-keygen.c; a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
- the standard library isnt in use
