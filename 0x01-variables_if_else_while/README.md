1. 0x01-variables_if_else_while : This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The program is to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
*The output of the program should be:*
The number, followed by
- if the number is greater than 0: is positive
- if the number is 0: is zero
- if the number is less than 0: is negative
- followed by a new line

2. 1-last_digit.c :This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The program is to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program. 
*The output of the program should be:*
- The string "Last digit of", followed by
- "n", followed by
- the string "is", followed by
- if the last digit of "n" is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"
- if the last digit of "n" is 0: the string "and is 0"
- if the last digit of "n" is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0"
- followed by a new line

2-print_alphabet.c :A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using the fucntion putchar twice, followed by a new line 

3-print_alphabets.c :A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase using the putchar function thrice, followed by a new line.

4-print_alphabt.c :A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except the letters "q" and "e" using the fuction putchar, followed by a new line.

5-print_numbers.c :a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6-print_numberz.c :A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 without using the variable char and only using putchar twice, followed by a new line.

7-print_tebahpla.c :a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

100-print_comb3.c : a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. 
- Numbers are separated by ",", followed by a space
-  The two digits are be different
- "01" and "10" are considered the same combination of the two digits "0" and "1"
- Prints only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits
- only the putchar function is in use at a maximum of five times
- minus the use of any variable of type char

101-print_comb4.c : a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
- Numbers are separated by ",", followed by a space
- The three digits are different
- 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
- Prints only the smallest combination of three digits
- Numbers are printed in ascending order, with three digits
- only the putchar function is in us at a six times maximum
- no variable of type char is in use

102-print_comb5.c : a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
- The numbers range from 0 to 99
- The two numbers are separated by a space
- All numbers are printed with two digits. 1 is printed as 01
- The combination of numbers is separated by comma, followed by a space
- The combinations of numbers is printed in ascending order
