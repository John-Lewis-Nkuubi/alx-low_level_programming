#Learning Objectives
*At the end of this project, i was be to explain to anyone, without the help of Google the following:*

##General
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

##Assinments
0-memset.c; a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
- Returns a pointer to the memory area s

1-memcpy.c; a function that copies memory area.
- The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
- Returns a pointer to dest

2-strchr.c; a function that locates a character in a string
- Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found

3-strspn.c; a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept

4-strpbrk.c; a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
- Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found

5-strstr.c; a function that locates a substring.
- The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
- Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.

7-print_chessboard.c; a function that prints the chessboard.

8-print_diagsums.c; a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

100-set_string.c; a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

101-crackme_password; a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
